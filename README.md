### Instructions to make a new instance for the whole tool ###

You need to have a WordPress site (4.7 or later) and Unity3D should be installed according to the following instructions:

A Server operating system with Ubuntu 16 or Windows 10 is required. The server software XAMPP with php 5.6 for Ubuntu or Windows should be used which is public available . WordPress 4.5 should be also installed which is also public available. XAMPP and WordPress are not developed in DigiArt and therefore there is no testing plan for them here. However, they should be installed and tested according to their vendors. If any modifications on their files are required to comply with DigiArt components, it will be explicitly stated.

Download Unity3D free version 2018.1 or later for Windows from Unity3D website. Install, run and activate it in the windows that will appear. The GUI of Unity3D should be loaded, otherwise an error will be prompted.

Then you download the whole repository as a zip and install it from plugins->add new->upload zip
